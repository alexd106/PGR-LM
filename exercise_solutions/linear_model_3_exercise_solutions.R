summary(birds.inter.1)

# Here the intercept (baseline) is the predicted `ABUND` for LOGAREA = 0,
# for FGRAZE level 1.
# the null hypothesis for the intercept is that the intercept = 0
# (not biologically relevant).

# LOGAREA represents the slope for LOGAREA, specific to level FGRAZE = 1.
# The null hypothesis is that the slope of the relationship
# between LOGAREA and ABUND = 0, for level FGRAZE = 1 only. 

# FGRAZE2...5 estimate differences (contrasts) between the *intercept* of
# each level and the *intercept* of the reference level, FGRAZE = 1. 

# FGRAZE2...5:LOGAREA estimate differences (contrasts) between the *slope*
# of LOGAREA for each level and the *slope* of LOGAREA for the reference
# level, FGRAZE = 1. 


# The Multiple R-square value is 0.76, so 76% of the variation in the data is explained by the model.

## # INTERACTIVE MODEL
## # The slopes of the LOGAREA effect across grazing levels are all over the
## # place, without any coherent pattern (for instance, they could have been
## # increasing or decreasing gradually from low to high grazing intensity).
## # From a model like this, it appears that abundance is broadly increasing
## # with patch size, however it is challenging to learn anything general
## # about the nature of the relationships between birds, in relation to
## # patch size and grazing.
## 
## # The interaction is non-significant, so isn't supported statistically either.
## 
## # Time to revert to a simpler, or an altogether different model?
## # More on this in the next exercise!
## 
## # Some observations are poorly predicted (fitted) using the current set
## # of predictors.
